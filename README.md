# Diabetes Prediction Algorithm

A machine learning based model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes using clinical and diagnostic data.

## Overview

This project implements a supervised machine learning approach to predict diabetes based on medical features. The dataset includes several health-related attributes, and the model aims to assist in early diagnosis by providing data-driven predictions.
